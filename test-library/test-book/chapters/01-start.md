# Chapter 1: The Beginning

The journey starts here in a small village nestled between rolling hills and a dark forest. The protagonist, Elena, a young cartographer, receives a mysterious map that will change her life forever.

Elena had always been fascinated by maps. Her small workshop was filled with charts of distant lands, ocean currents, and mountain ranges she had never seen. But this map was different. It appeared on her doorstep one morning, wrapped in oiled leather and tied with a cord that seemed to shimmer in the early light.

The parchment was ancient, its edges yellowed with age, and the ink had faded to a deep brown. Strange symbols marked various locations, and at the center was a place simply labeled "The Heart of the World."

As Elena studied the map, she noticed that some of the symbols seemed to move when she wasn't looking directly at them. A chill ran down her spine, but her curiosity was stronger than her fear.
