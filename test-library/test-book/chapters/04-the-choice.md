# Chapter 4: The Choice Made

Elena's hand hovered over the crystal showing her burning village. She couldn't abandon her home, no matter what adventures awaited her elsewhere. As her fingers touched the warm crystal surface, the world around her dissolved.

She found herself standing on a hill overlooking her village, but something was wrong. The buildings were intact, but no smoke rose from the chimneys, no people walked the streets. It was as if time itself had stopped.

"You chose love over adventure," Lysander's voice echoed around her, though he was nowhere to be seen. "This is both your greatest strength and your greatest weakness. The Heart of the World requires someone who can balance both."

A new path appeared on Elena's map, leading not away from her village but through it, into a hidden chamber beneath the old church. She had passed that building hundreds of times but never noticed the strange symbols carved into its foundationâ€”symbols that now matched those on her map.

As Elena approached the church, she realized that her real journey was just beginning. The map hadn't brought her to a distant land after all; it had brought her home to discover secrets that had been hidden in plain sight her entire life.

The door to the church stood open, revealing stairs that descended into darkness. Elena lit her lantern and began her descent, the map glowing brighter with each step she took into the unknown depths below her familiar village.
