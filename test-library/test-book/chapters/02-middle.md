# Chapter 2: The Forest Path

Elena decided to follow the map's guidance, which led her deep into the Whispering Forest. The trees here were ancient and tall, their canopy so thick that very little sunlight reached the forest floor.

As she walked deeper into the woods, Elena began to hear sounds that didn't belong—whispers in languages she didn't recognize, the soft padding of feet that stopped whenever she turned around, and a constant low humming that seemed to come from the earth itself.

The map in her hands grew warm, and the symbols began to glow with a faint blue light. According to the markings, she was approaching the first waypoint: the Crystal Grove.

When Elena finally reached the clearing, she gasped. Dozens of crystal formations jutted from the ground, each one pulsing with the same blue light as her map. In the center of the grove stood a figure she had thought was a statue—until it turned to look at her.

"You have come at last, mapmaker," the figure said, its voice echoing strangely among the crystals. "The Heart of the World awaits, but the path is treacherous. Are you prepared for what lies ahead?"
