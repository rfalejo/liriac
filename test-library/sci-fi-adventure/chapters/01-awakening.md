# Chapter 1: Awakening

Commander Sarah Chen slowly regained consciousness, her head pounding as if a meteor had struck it. The hibernation pod's systems hummed quietly around her, their blue glow casting eerie shadows on the curved walls of her sleeping chamber.

According to the pod's display, she had been asleep for 127 years. The colony ship *Harmony* was supposed to wake her in 150 years when they reached the Kepler-442b system. Something had gone wrong.

Sarah's training kicked in as she performed the standard post-hibernation checks. Vital signs: stable. Ship's systems: mostly operational. Crew status: that's where things got concerning. Of the 10,000 colonists aboard, only 23 pods showed active life signs.

As she pulled herself from the pod, Sarah's legs nearly buckled. 127 years of muscle atrophy couldn't be completely prevented, even with the advanced hibernation technology. She grabbed the emergency stim-pack from the pod's medical kit and injected herself, feeling strength slowly return to her limbs.

The ship's AI, ARIA, activated as soon as Sarah was fully conscious. "Commander Chen, welcome back. I regret to inform you that we have experienced a catastrophic event. Please report to the bridge for immediate briefing."

Sarah's blood ran cold. A catastrophic event that killed 99.77% of the crew? This was not the peaceful journey to humanity's new home that they had planned.
