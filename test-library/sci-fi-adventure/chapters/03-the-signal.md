# Chapter 3: The Signal

The conference room felt empty with only 23 people scattered around a table designed for 50. Sarah looked at the faces of the survivors—engineers, scientists, medics, and agricultural specialists. Each one bore the weight of loss and the uncertainty of their situation.

Dr. Elena Martinez, the ship's chief medical officer, spoke first. "Commander, we've done everything we can for the hibernation casualties. The pods that failed... there was nothing we could do. The gravitational stress caused massive system failures."

Chief Engineer Kenji Nakamura was next. "The ship is stable but badly damaged. We have life support, minimal propulsion, and about 60% of our computer systems. The alien station... it's been transmitting to us."

Sarah felt a chill. "Transmitting what?"

"That's the thing," Kenji continued, pulling up a holographic display. "It's not random signals. It's responding to our presence. Watch this."

The display showed the station's energy patterns. As the *Harmony* had approached, the station's lights had begun pulsing in a specific sequence. When their ship had broadcast a standard greeting protocol, the station had responded with mathematical sequences—prime numbers, the Fibonacci sequence, and then something more complex.

"It's trying to communicate," said Dr. Sarah Kim, the xenobiologist. "The mathematical progressions are clearly intelligent design. But there's something else."

She manipulated the display to show a translation matrix. "If we assume this pattern represents a coordinate system, it's not showing us where we are—it's showing us where we need to go. This station... I think it's some kind of waypoint."

Sarah stared at the data. "You're saying this alien station is trying to guide us somewhere?"

"That's exactly what I'm saying. And based on the energy readings, I think it's offering to help repair our ship first."
