# Chapter 2: Station Alpha

The bridge of the *Harmony* was a testament to human ingenuity—or at least, it had been before whatever disaster had struck. Half the control panels were dark, their holographic displays flickering intermittently. Sarah made her way to the captain's chair, her magnetic boots clicking against the metal floor in the low gravity.

"ARIA, report status," Sarah commanded, settling into the familiar chair she had hoped never to occupy under these circumstances.

"Commander, at 0347 hours ship time, approximately three weeks ago, we encountered an uncharted gravitational anomaly. The ship was pulled off course and sustained significant damage to the hibernation systems. Most pods experienced critical failures during the emergency wake protocols."

Sarah's hands trembled slightly as she processed this information. Three weeks. The 23 survivors had been awake for three weeks, trying to repair the ship and save their fellow colonists.

"Where are the other survivors?" she asked.

"Currently working in Engineering Section C and the Hydroponics Bay. Dr. Martinez has been coordinating the medical response while Chief Engineer Nakamura has been attempting to restore primary systems."

Sarah activated the ship's internal communications. "All survivors, this is Commander Chen. Please report to the main conference room in one hour for a full briefing."

As she waited, Sarah accessed the ship's sensors to see where they were. What she found made her gasp. They weren't in empty space—they were approaching a massive space station of completely alien design, its crystalline structure pulsing with an otherworldly energy.
