# Chapter 1: The Heist

Detective Rebecca Stone stood in the center of the Meridian Gallery, surrounded by empty frames and shattered glass. The most audacious art theft in the city's history had taken place just hours ago, and the crime scene was unlike anything she had seen in her fifteen years on the force.

"Thirty-seven paintings," said Officer Martinez, consulting his tablet. "All taken in less than twenty minutes according to the security footage. But here's the weird part—they only took specific pieces, and they left behind paintings worth twice as much."

Rebecca crouched next to a pile of cut canvas. The thieves hadn't been careful about preserving the artwork; they had sliced the paintings from their frames with surgical precision but had shown no concern for the artistic value. This wasn't about money.

"What do we know about the alarm system?" she asked.

"That's the strangest part," Martinez replied. "The alarm never went off. Every sensor, every camera, every motion detector—they all show normal readings during the theft. It's like the thieves were invisible."

Rebecca examined the security office next. The guards on duty, Henry Walsh and Maria Santos, had been found unconscious but unharmed. The medical team said they showed signs of being drugged with an unknown substance that had left them with no memory of the previous evening.

As she studied the security monitors, Rebecca noticed something that made her blood run cold. At exactly 11:47 PM, all the cameras showed the same thing for exactly thirty seconds: complete darkness. Not static, not damage—just pure, uniform black.

"Martinez," she called out, "get me everything we have on the stolen paintings. I want to know if there's any connection between them besides being in the same gallery."
