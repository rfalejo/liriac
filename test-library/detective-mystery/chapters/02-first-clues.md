# Chapter 2: First Clues

Back at the precinct, Rebecca spread the files across her desk like pieces of a puzzle. The stolen paintings seemed random at first—different artists, different time periods, different styles. But as she dug deeper, a pattern began to emerge.

"Look at this," she said to her partner, Detective James Park, who had just arrived with coffee and donuts. "Every single stolen painting was donated to the gallery by the same person: Victoria Ashworth."

James nearly choked on his coffee. "The Victoria Ashworth? The reclusive millionaire who disappeared five years ago?"

"The very same. According to these records, she donated these specific thirty-seven paintings over the course of twenty years, but here's the interesting part—she personally insisted they be displayed together in the east wing."

Rebecca pulled up Victoria's file on her computer. Ashworth had been one of the city's most prominent art collectors before her sudden disappearance. Her mansion had been found empty, with no signs of struggle. The case had gone cold years ago.

"There's something else," James said, studying the gallery's floor plan. "The east wing isn't just where Ashworth's donations were displayed—it's the oldest part of the building. It used to be a private mansion before it was converted to a gallery."

Rebecca felt the pieces clicking together. "Whose mansion?"

James was already typing on his computer. After a few minutes, he looked up with wide eyes. "It belonged to Victoria Ashworth's great-grandfather, Augustus Ashworth. He built it in 1892, and it stayed in the family until Victoria donated it to the city in 1998."

"So someone breaks into the gallery and steals only the paintings that Victoria Ashworth donated, all from the wing that used to be her family's home," Rebecca mused. "This isn't random. Someone knows something about those paintings that we don't."
