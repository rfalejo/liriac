# Ticket LR-01A: Strong Type Hinting

## Description
Implement strong type hinting across the entire liriac codebase to ensure type safety and catch potential bugs early. This involves configuring mypy with strict settings in the pyproject.toml file and ensuring all code in the liriac/ package is fully type-hinted and passes mypy checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Configure `mypy` in `pyproject.toml` with strict settings
- All code in `liriac/` is fully type-hinted and passes `mypy` checks
- Type annotations are comprehensive and cover all function signatures, variables, and return types
- No mypy errors or warnings when running against the liriac package

## Testing Strategy
- CI step to run `mypy liriac/` and fail on any type errors
- Ensure new code is type-annotated as part of code reviews
- Manual verification that mypy passes cleanly on all existing code
- Test that type annotations are accurate and meaningful
