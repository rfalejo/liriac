# Ticket BL-002: CLI `liriac` with `--path` and minimal Textual bootstrap

## Description
Introduce the first executable entry point for the application and a minimal TUI shell:
- Add a Typer-based CLI (`liriac`) with an option `--path` that selects the library/workspace directory; default to the current working directory.
- Validate the `--path` argument (must exist and be a directory); provide a clear error message and non-zero exit when invalid.
- Bootstrap a minimal Textual app that starts successfully and immediately renders a placeholder screen. The TUI contains no business logic yet; it simply accepts a `library_path: Path` and can be exited by `q` or `Ctrl+C`.
- Keep strict typing and project conventions from BL-001. No network calls. No configuration file/env precedence yet (that is part of later tickets).

Context from technical spec:
- CLI should be `liriac`, managed via uv and exposed via `[project.scripts]`.
- TUI is built with Textual; this ticket only boots the app and passes the selected path through a typed boundary.
- Default library directory is the current directory unless overridden by CLI `--path`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CLI entry point:
  - `src/liriac/cli.py` defines a Typer `app` and the root command `liriac`.
  - Option `--path PATH` (optional) defaults to the current working directory.
  - Validates that `PATH` exists and is a directory; on invalid input, prints a concise error and returns a non-zero exit code without a traceback.
  - Calls into `src/liriac/app.py` to launch the TUI, passing a `pathlib.Path`.
- TUI bootstrap:
  - `src/liriac/app.py` provides a minimal Textual `App` subclass (e.g., `LiriacApp`) that accepts `library_path: Path`.
  - The app renders a simple placeholder view (title or message) and can be closed via `q` or `Ctrl+C` without errors.
  - No domain/services logic yet; no filesystem writes; no network.
- Packaging and dependencies:
  - `pyproject.toml` adds runtime dependencies for `typer` and `textual`.
  - `[project.scripts]` includes `liriac = "liriac.cli:app"`.
- Tooling and quality gates:
  - Code is fully typed (`mypy --strict` passes).
  - `ruff` and `black` pass with no changes after initial format.
  - `make run ARGS="--path ."` launches the TUI.
- Tests:
  - `tests/test_cli.py` includes:
    - `--help` runs successfully (exit code 0).
    - Invoking with a valid temporary directory returns exit code 0 (smoke).
    - Invoking with a non-existent path returns non-zero and includes an error message.
  - Import of `LiriacApp` succeeds in tests without launching the UI event loop.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit/CLI tests (Typer):
  - Use `typer.testing.CliRunner` to test `--help`, valid path, and invalid path scenarios; assert exit codes and messages.
  - Use `tmp_path` (pytest fixture) to provide a valid directory.
- TUI smoke tests:
  - Import `LiriacApp` to ensure module loads with strict typing; do not start the event loop in tests.
- Developer workflow:
  - `make venv && make sync`
  - `make fmt && make lint`
  - `make typecheck`
  - `make test`
  - Manual smoke: `make run ARGS="--path ."` should open the minimal TUI and exit cleanly with `q`.
