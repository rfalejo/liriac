# Ticket LR-01: Bootstrap Project Tooling

## Description
Set up the foundational project tooling for liriac, a distraction-free Python TUI for writing long-form books. This task involves creating the essential configuration files and a launcher script that enable a "clone and run" experience with minimal dependencies. The tooling must support both the preferred `uv` package manager and provide a fallback to standard venv + pip for users without `uv`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create `pyproject.toml` that pins Python to `==3.11.*`, includes `prompt_toolkit>=3,<4` as a dependency, and sets up a script entry point `liriac = liriac.cli:main`
- Create `requirements.txt` listing `prompt_toolkit>=3,<4` as a fallback for pip users
- Create an executable `run` script that enforces Python 3.11 and prefers `uv` for dependency management, falling back to venv + pip if `uv` is not available
- The `run` script must create `.venv/` directory and install dependencies automatically when `uv` is not available
- Ensure `./run` executes a no-op CLI that exits with code 0 and prints help (requires minimal CLI skeleton to be created)

## Testing Strategy
- Shell smoke tests for `./run`, `uv run liriac`, and `python -m liriac` in CI
- Verify script permissions (executable) and Python version enforcement
- Test both `uv` and venv + pip paths work correctly
- Assert that the basic CLI structure exists and responds with help text
- Verify that the `run` script handles missing `uv` gracefully and creates the virtual environment automatically
