# Review of Ticket LR-01: Bootstrap Project Tooling

## Summary
The junior developer has successfully implemented the foundational project tooling for liriac, creating all required configuration files and a launcher script that provides a "clone and run" experience. The implementation follows the technical specification exactly, supporting both uv and venv+pip dependency management paths.

## Verification of Acceptance Criteria
- **pyproject.toml creation**: **Verified** - The file exists with correct Python pinning `==3.11.*`, includes `prompt_toolkit>=3,<4` dependency, and sets up script entry point `liriac = liriac.cli:main`
- **requirements.txt creation**: **Verified** - The file exists and lists `prompt_toolkit>=3,<4` as fallback for pip users
- **Executable run script**: **Verified** - The script exists, is executable (755 permissions), enforces Python 3.11, prefers uv, and falls back to venv + pip
- **Automatic venv creation**: **Verified** - When uv is not available, the script creates `.venv/` directory and installs dependencies automatically
- **No-op CLI execution**: **Verified** - `./run` executes a CLI that exits with code 0 and prints helpful usage information

## Testing Strategy Review
- **Shell smoke tests**: **Adequate** - Verified all three execution methods work (`./run`, `uv run liriac`, `python -m liriac`) and exit with code 0
- **Script permissions**: **Adequate** - Confirmed the run script has executable permissions (755)
- **Python version enforcement**: **Adequate** - Script checks for `python3.11` and exits with error if not found
- **Both dependency paths tested**: **Adequate** - Successfully tested both uv path and venv + pip fallback path
- **CLI structure verification**: **Adequate** - Basic CLI exists in `liriac/cli.py` with proper entry points and help text

## Overall Assessment
The implementation is **complete and correct**. All acceptance criteria have been met with high quality:

**Strengths:**
- Perfect adherence to the technical specification
- Clean, well-structured bash script with proper error handling
- Both uv and venv+pip paths work correctly
- Python version enforcement is robust
- CLI skeleton provides clear user guidance
- All file permissions are correctly set

**Areas of Excellence:**
- The run script uses proper bash practices (`set -euo pipefail`)
- Error messages are user-friendly and clear
- The fallback venv creation works seamlessly
- Entry points are correctly configured for multiple invocation methods

**Minor Notes:**
- No issues identified; implementation exceeds expectations for a bootstrap ticket

## Next Steps
- **No additional tasks required** - Ticket LR-01 is complete and ready for review
- **Proceed to LR-02** - The foundation is solid for implementing the CLI & Entry Points ticket
- **CI integration** - Consider adding the verified shell smoke tests to CI pipeline for regression testing

**Recommendation:** **APPROVE** - The implementation fully satisfies all requirements and demonstrates excellent attention to detail.
